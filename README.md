# Vibrance

[Demo w/ Audio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d989be6-9f00-4b2a-b5c0-240a554bc1ae)


This is a personal fork of https://github.com/mpaepper/vibevoice. It's designed to fit my use case, versus being user-friendly.

It uses the right-hand CTRL+SHIFT combo as the push-to-talk trigger. You can change this to whatever you want, but you'll have to rig it up.

This is incredibly slow if you use CPU.

## Features added

- Easily extensible one-word or phrase macros, such as "today's date", and simple voice-controlled keyboard inputs.

## Fixed stuff

- Cleaned up console output.
- Voice input under 500ms will be ignored to avoid false responses.

## Support

- None. This is a work in progress, but I'm also not looking for contributons. Feel free to fork the project, if you want, like I did with Vibevoice.
